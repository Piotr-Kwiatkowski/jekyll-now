Make your own site -- they said.<br>
It will be fun -- they said.<br>

Well -- fun up your ass! \**loud noises*\*

My god. I will never finish this. Simply never.<br>
And it's still only a default theme!

Well, of course it was my fault and lack of understanding the tool.<br>
Wanting to have it done with the smallest possible effort -- smart, isn't it?<br>
But here it is. In all its glory.<br>

Since I have site finally established, I can focus on other projects.<br>
I have some article draft about floating points, maybe I should finish it...
